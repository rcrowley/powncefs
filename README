NAME
	powncefs -- A Fuse filesystem for your friends' files on Pownce

SYNOPSIS
	./powncefs.py <mountpoint>

DESCRIPTION
	Creates a directory for each of your friends on Pownce containing
	all of the files they've uploaded to the site.

DEPENDENCIES
	First, you'll need to install Leah's OAuth Python library.  I
	don't know if this is the best way to do it but it actually works,
	so whatever.

	$ cd /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/
	$ sudo svn co http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/python/oauth

	You will also need Fuse and the Python bindings.  In Ubuntu, these
	are easy to fetch.

	$ sudo apt-get install python-fuse
